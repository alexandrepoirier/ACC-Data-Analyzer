Before you get started, you need to install the three dependencies for this
program :
    
- Python 2.7.6 or higher, though the 2.7.6 version is recommended (https://www.python.org)
- numpy library (http://www.numpy.org)
- pyo module for python (https://code.google.com/p/pyo/downloads/list)

NOTE : I highly recommend you install 32-bit versions of these dependencies
since 64-bit versions are known to cause problems, and might even
cause the application to be unable to launch on certain machines.

In order to install the program, just run the "install.sh" script in the terminal.
To do so, change directories (cd) to the one where de script is found and simply
run "sh install.sh" in the terminal. This script will automatically create a
"uninstall.sh" script that you can run to get the application off yor system.
Note that right before finishing the installation, the terminal will ask for your
password in order to copy the command file to the /usr/local/bin folder.

Once the application is properly installed, all you have to do is write "accdata"
in the terminal window and the application will start.
